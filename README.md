# Practice 2012 - 00: Roll Call

## Background
Mr. Petersworth is a 10th grade history teacher at True Blue High School.
The principal of True Blue gives Mr. Petersworth a list of the students in
his class with their first and last names on separate lines. This is slow for
taking attendance; Mr. Petersworth would rather first and last names be
on the same line, with the last name before the first name.

## Description
### Input
The first line of input is the number of test cases that follow. Each test
case contains two strings on separate lines, with the first string being the student’s first name and the
second string as the student’s last name. Both the first and last name will be less than 20 characters long.
### Output
For each case, output the line “Case x:” where x is the case number, on a single line. This is followed by
the full name entered, using the format “Last, First”.

## Sample

### Input
